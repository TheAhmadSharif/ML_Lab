In statistical modeling, the aim is often to model the relationship between several ex-
planatory variables X1, X2, . . . , Xp and one response variable Y .
– The response variable Y is assumed to be a random variable with the probability dis-
tribution defined by the density function fY (y|x, β), where x = (X1, X2, . . . , Xp)′ and
β = (β0, β1, . . . , βp)′ is unknown parameter vector, β ∈ Rp+1.


where ϵ is the error term, typically assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and constant variance
