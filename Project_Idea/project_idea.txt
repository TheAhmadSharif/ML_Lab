3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Dimensions Reduction – learn eigenvalues and eigenvectors (used in feature extraction) – Reduce the dimensionality of a dataset of face images for facial recognition.

4. Implementing a Simple k-Means Clustering Algorithm – learn euclidean distances (optimization through distance minimization) – Group customer data into clusters based on shopping behaviors.

5. Creating a Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier – learn the optimization and Lagrange multipliers (constrained optimization techniques) – Classify tumors as malignant or benign using a medical dataset.

6. Training a Deep Neural Network with Backpropagation – learn gradient descent (calculation of gradients and optimization) – Train a deep network to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

7. Time Series Forecasting with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) – learn differential equations usage (temporal dependencies and time derivatives) – Predict future stock prices based on historical data.

8. Natural Language Processing with Word2Vec Embeddings – learn cosine similarity and tensors (measuring similarity between word vectors) – Build a recommendation system for books based on similarities in reviews.

9. Building a Bayesian Classifier for Text Classification – learn bayesian probabilities (prior and posterior probabilities) – Classify email messages as spam or not spam.

10. Implementing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) – learn about game theory (min-max optimization problem between generator and discriminator)
