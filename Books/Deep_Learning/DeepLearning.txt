∀ (the upside-down A) → "for all" / "for every" / sometimes just "forall" (as one word in very informal tech/math talks)

Information Theory (in very simple English)
Information theory is basically a math way to measure how much "surprise" or how much new knowledge is carried inside a message, signal, or any piece of data.
It doesn't care what the message means emotionally or semantically — it only cares about how unpredictable or how rare the symbols (letters, bits, words, sounds) are.
The more unpredictable something is, the more information it contains.
Super simple analogy: The guessing game
Imagine you're playing "20 Questions" with a friend who is thinking of an animal.

If they say "It's a dog" → very little surprise → little information (dogs are common).
If they say "It's a platypus" → huge surprise → lots of information (platypus is rare and weird).


Rounding error (also called round-off error) is a tiny inaccuracy that happens in computers because they can't store or calculate most real numbers (like 0.1 or π) exactly — they have to approximate them using a limited number of bits.

What is the softmax function? (simple English + analogy)
The softmax function is a mathematical trick used in machine learning (especially neural networks) to turn a list of raw numbers (called logits or scores) into a list of probabilities that add up to exactly 1.
Formula (for the i-th position):
softmax(x)_i = exp(x_i) / (exp(x_1) + exp(x_2) + ... + exp(x_n))
