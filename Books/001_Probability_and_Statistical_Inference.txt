I am reading following book. I will share some paragraphs. And you will interpret or summarize the paragraphs briefly with naive examples

Most distributions model real-world outcomes directly:
✅ Binomial: count of successes
✅ Exponential: time until first event
✅ Normal: real-valued measurements
✅ Gamma: total time until multiple events
✅ Beta: probability distributions on [0, 1]

Bi-variate Normal Distribution

Topic: Bi-variate Normal Distribution

What is Bi-variate Normal Distribution
What is the purpose and use of it
When is it used



In Binomial distribution , There are two possible out comes from n trials.

In Exponential distribution, how long will it take to happen first event 


Beta ....

and so on.

But for F-distribution, why when comparing two variances ? It does not similar with other probability distribution. 

Can you explain ?
