Support vector machine is a supervised machine learning algorithm.


It is used to find
1. Classification
2. Regression



The maximum margin linear classifier is the linear classifier. This is the simplest kind of SVM. 

1. In which aspects SVM is different than other classification
2. What is the advanatges when Marginal difference max, if not 3. What would possible problems we enocounters
4. How SVM works?

Kersns are set of functions used to transform data from lower dimension to higher dimention and to manipulate data using dot product at higher dimentions.
