Converge : Tend to meet a point 

Expectation works with random variables for probable values.

Expectation vs. Mean
–––––––––––––––––––––––
Expectation works with random variables for probable values.

Mean works with data in STatistics to gather averages of concrete numbers from a sample or population.

Sometimes expectations referred as mean


Expectation is use in statistical inference to estimate population parameters, test hypothesis and make predictions based on sample data. It is related to law of large numbers.


Coin Example: 

Heads(1)  : 0.6
Tail (0)  : 0.4

E(x) = 1x0.6 + 0x0.4
     = 0.6

     


–––––––– Discrete Uniform Distribution 
Equal Probability of all values 
E(X) = a + b / 2

a = Max value
b = min Value
