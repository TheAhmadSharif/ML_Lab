K-means is an unsupervised classification algorithm that groups objects into k groups based on their characteristics. It is also called “clusterization.” K-means clustering is one of the simplest and very popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

Training Data:

Training data is typically larger than testing data. This is because we want to feed the model with as much data as possible to find and learn meaningful patterns. 

Algorithms enable machines to solve problems based on past observations. Kind of like learning from example, just like humans. The only difference is that machines require a lot more examples in order to be able to see patterns and learn.
