Here are several alternative ways to compare goals scored and goals conceded across different n-year intervals, beyond traditional bar charts or Z-scores:

1. Line Charts with Multiple Series

Plot each opponent as a separate line.

X-axis: Time intervals (e.g., "1990–1999", "2000–2009").

Y-axis: Goals scored/conceded per match or total.

Two separate plots: one for scored, one for conceded.

Good for seeing trends over time.

2. Normalized Comparison (Min-Max Scaling)

Scale each opponent's goal stats between 0 and 1.

Plot using grouped bars or radar charts.

Useful when comparing across teams with vastly different scoring volumes.

3. Radar (Spider) Charts

Each axis is a different interval.

One chart per opponent.

Plot goals scored vs. conceded as two lines.

Good for visualizing balance between scoring and conceding across intervals.

4. Area Charts

Stack goals scored and goals conceded as shaded areas.

Use different colors for scored/conceded.

X-axis: Time intervals.

Visually shows contribution over time and trends.

5. Heatmaps

Rows: Opponents

Columns: Intervals

Color intensity represents values (e.g., goals scored per match).

Use separate heatmaps for scored and conceded or combine with diverging color map.

6. Box Plots or Violin Plots

Show distribution of per-match goals scored/conceded across intervals.

Great for understanding spread and outliers, not just averages.

7. Goal Difference (Scored – Conceded)

One metric that combines both aspects.

Plot as a bar or line chart over intervals.

8. Cumulative Trend

Cumulative goals scored/conceded over time (intervals).

Highlights long-term strength or weaknesses.

9. Comparative Indexing

Choose a base interval (e.g., 1990–1999).

Express other intervals as a percentage relative to the base.

E.g., “Goals scored in 2000–2009 were 120% of 1990–1999.”

10. Z-Score or T-Score Trend Lines

Already implemented in your code.

Helps identify relative performance fluctuations per opponent.

Regression:
Linear Regression: Predict goal difference based on venue or year.

Logistic Regression: Predict probability of win/loss (binary outcome).

Rating Systems:
Elo Rating Updates: Dynamically rate team strength after each match.

Power Index: Combine offensive and defensive strength ratings.






 8. Situational Analysis
Although your dataset is small, these can be insightful with larger data:

First Goal Advantage: Who scored first and won?

Comebacks: Win after being behind.

Clean Sheets: Matches with zero goals conceded.
