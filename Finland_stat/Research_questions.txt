1. Total matches played in every n year (Note: 2) by country_1 and country_2 (Note: 1), country_3 (Note: 1), and plotted as a grouped bar chart ## Done
2. Time or Year against Cumulative goal and matches ## Done
3. Average goals played by country list in a time interval show in box plot. ## Done 
4. Average goals held in every match played by country_1 in every n years (Note: 2) and plot in a grouped bar chart  ## Done
5. Average goals held in every match played by country_1 against country_2 in every n years (Note: 2) and plot as a Grouped bar chart ## Done


6. Average Win/loss played by country_1 against country_2 and country_3 in every n years, and plot as a Grouped bar chart ## Done

7. Average goal score played by country_1 against country_2 in every n years, and plot as a grouped bar chart ## Done
12. Top n countries' highest score on average and graph in bubble plot and grouped bar chart


13. Top n countries highest concede on average and graphed in a bubble plot, grouped bar chart
14. Win/loss percentage in every n years by country_1 against all other countries, use a bar chart

Present this table in an appropriate graph

21. Apply correlated team by using statistical correlation formula by comparing goal score, goal concede, win/loss match parameter. 


22. Implement k-means Cluster by using goal-score (x-axis), goal-concede (y-axis)





Note: 
1. country_2 and country_3 are optional parameter.
2. The year number will be provided as a function parameter
3. In every case, use a bar chart, and when multiple countries are provided as country_1, country_2, then plot as a Grouped bar chart
4. Every time, print/display the table
5. First, write the 15 questions in a list or appendix in Markdown and style them accordingly, if necessary.
6. Every time, use the title question and write code as well as a plot

Can you please share code to implement 
1. Average Win/loss played by team_1 ("Finland") vs Opponent ["Sweden", "Norway", "Denmark"] in every n years and plot in a bar chart
If opposite_team is not provided then count all of them.
2. Include mean (Dash Line) and standard deviation (Rectangular)

Can you please share code to implement 
def average_goal_score_conced(df, interval = 10, team_1 = "Finland", opposite_team = ["Sweden", "Norway", "Denmark"], start_year = 1990, end_year = 2024):


7. Average goal scored and conceded played by team_1 against opposite_team in every n years, and plot as a grouped bar chart and stack. 


Include goal difference in the stack graph. Goal score + concede + Goal difference in one bar stack graph
 If it is positive I mean win the game then color it withrgb(8, 162, 201) If negative or lost the game then color it withrgb(249, 206, 65)
