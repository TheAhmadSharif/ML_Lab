Is it the correct structure while make a Convolutional Neural Network

Convolutional Neural Network Steps 

1. Load Dataset
2. Preprocessing Data
    a. Resize Image
    b. Separate Train and Test Data 
3. Train Data 
4. Build CNN Model 
5. Compile Model 
6. Fit Model 
7. Calculate different performance metrics
    a. Accuracy
    b. Recall
    c. F1-Score
    d. Sensitivity
    e. Specificity

The biggest issue was the order of steps 3 and 4. You must build the model before you can train it. Your original ordering implied training before building, which is not possible.


Convolutional Neural Network Steps 

1. Load Dataset
2. Preprocessing Data
    a. Resize Image
    b. Separate Train and Test Data 
    c. Normalize Pixel Values
    d. One-Hot Encode Labels (if needed)
    e. Data Augmentation (apply to the training data)

3. Build CNN Model 
    a. Transfer Learning (load a pre-trained model as a starting point)   
    b. Add new layers as needed
4. Compile Model 
5. Train/Fit Model 
6. Calculate different performance metrics
    a. Accuracy
    b. Recall
    c. F1-Score
    d. Sensitivity
    e. Specificity
