We consider events,

A = Sunny
B = Rain

P(A) = Probability of sunny = 0.3
P(B) = Probability of rain = 0.4 = Prior Probability

P(B|A) = Probability of rain occurring given that mornings are sunny 
∴ P(B|A) = 0.45 = Likelihood probability.

P(A|B) = Probability of sunny given that its rain
∴ P(A|B) = Posterior probability = ? 

P(A|B) = (0.45 x 0.3 ) / 0.4
P(A|B) = 0.34
