Supervised Learning – the data is labeled and you need to learn a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs

Unsupervised Learning – the data is not labeled and you need to find some structure in your data to formulate conclusions about it

Reinforcement Learning – you have an environment, an agent, a set of actions and you need to learn dynamically by adjusting the agent’s actions based on continuous feedback to maximize the overall reward

Semi-Supervised Learning – you need to solve some problem having a data set with both labeled and unlabeled data
