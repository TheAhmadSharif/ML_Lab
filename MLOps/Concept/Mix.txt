What Is Principal Component Analysis? Principal component analysis, or PCA, is a dimensionality-reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.



An interval scale is one where there is order and the difference between two values is meaningful. Examples of interval variables include: temperature (Farenheit), temperature (Celcius), pH, SAT score (200-800), credit score (300-850).

Where you cannot imply that the temperature is twice as warm outside because it’s an interval scale, you can say you are twice another’s age because it’s a ratio variable.
