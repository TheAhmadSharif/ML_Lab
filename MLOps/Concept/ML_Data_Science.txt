Data science implies that there is a science-intensive task around data. It’s a research question you’re trying to answer or a serious problem you can solve by extracting insights from data. Examples of data science tasks are identifying and predicting diseases or providing personalized healthcare advice. Usually, these tasks are quite complex so data scientists most often work in teams.

For example, Netflix uses data science techniques to understand user interest by mining the data and viewing patterns of its users.
