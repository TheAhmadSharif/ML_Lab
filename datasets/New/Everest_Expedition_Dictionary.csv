peaks,open,The peak is on the Nepal government’s approved list of peaks open to mountaineering expeditions (Y/N)
peaks,unlisted,The peak is not on any Nepal government list of approved peaks and thus is not legally open for mountaineering. The database contains several such peaks either because they were climbed illegally or were climbed long ago when mountaineering was less regulated. Unlisted peaks are included in the statistical reports and analyses. (Y/N)
peaks,trekking,The peak is on the Nepal government’s approved list of trekking peaks. Trekking peaks are not included in the statistical reports and analyses after the year they were listed (see trekyear). A few peaks such as Cholatse and Langshisa Ri that were once open have now been reclassified as trekking peaks. (Y/N)

In some cases, the ascent has been marked as disputed because the summit party disappeared and thus the ascent cannot be verified.
