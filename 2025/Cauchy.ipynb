    "### 🔹 What is the **Cauchy Distribution**?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Cauchy distribution** is a continuous probability distribution that is **bell-shaped like the normal distribution**, but it has **much heavier tails** — meaning **more probability is in the extremes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also known as the **Lorentz distribution** or **Breit–Wigner distribution** in physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 **PDF of Cauchy Distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a Cauchy distribution with **location** \\( x_0 \\) (center) and **scale** \\( \\gamma > 0 \\) (controls width), the probability density function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x; x_0, \\gamma) = \\frac{1}{\\pi \\gamma \\left[1 + \\left(\\frac{x - x_0}{\\gamma}\\right)^2\\right]}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( x_0 \\): location (similar to the mean, but the mean doesn't exist!)\n",
    "- \\( \\gamma \\): scale (similar to standard deviation, but again, not quite!)\n",

    "### ✅ **Naïve Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you're measuring how long people wait for a bus at a station. Usually, it takes 10 minutes, but **occasionally there's a massive delay** (traffic jam, breakdown).\n",
    "\n",
    "A **normal distribution** would underestimate these rare long delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "But a **Cauchy distribution** would capture those **extreme, rare, long waits** better, because its **tails are heavier** — it assumes such outliers are more likely.\n",

    "### 🔸 **Applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Physics**: Used to describe **resonance behavior** in quantum mechanics and optics.\n",
    "- **Statistics**: A famous example of a **pathological distribution** — used to **show what goes wrong** if you blindly apply techniques assuming normality.\n",
    "- **Simulation Testing**: Used to **stress-test** algorithms because of its unusual properties (no mean or variance).\n",
