Data science implies that there is a science-intensive task around data. It’s a research question you’re trying to answer or a serious problem you can solve by extracting insights from data. Examples of data science tasks are identifying and predicting diseases or providing personalized healthcare advice. Usually, these tasks are quite complex so data scientists most often work in teams.

For example, Netflix uses data science techniques to understand user interest by mining the data and viewing patterns of its users.

Machine learning is a part of artificial intelligence and the subfield of Data Science. It is a growing technology that enables machines to learn from past data and perform a given task automatically. It can be defined as:


It deals with understanding and finding hidden patterns or useful insights from the data, which helps to take smarter business decisions.	
It is a subfield of data science that enables the machine to learn from the past data and experiences automatically.


It is used for discovering insights from the data.	
It is used for making predictions and classifying the result for new data points.

Supervised Learning – the data is labeled and you need to learn a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs

Unsupervised Learning – the data is not labeled and you need to find some structure in your data to formulate conclusions about it

Reinforcement Learning – you have an environment, an agent, a set of actions and you need to learn dynamically by adjusting the agent’s actions based on continuous feedback to maximize the overall reward

Semi-Supervised Learning – you need to solve some problem having a data set with both labeled and unlabeled data

K-means is an unsupervised classification algorithm that groups objects into k groups based on their characteristics. It is also called “clusterization.” K-means clustering is one of the simplest and very popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

Training data is typically larger than testing data. This is because we want to feed the model with as much data as possible to find and learn meaningful patterns. 

Algorithms enable machines to solve problems based on past observations. Kind of like learning from example, just like humans. The only difference is that machines require a lot more examples in order to be able to see patterns and learn.
