Let's introduce different numbers in each group to create some variation:

- Group A (Study Method A): 1, 2, 4, 1, 3
- Group B (Study Method B): 2, 3, 5, 2, 4
- Group C (Study Method C): 3, 4, 1, 3, 5

Now, let's go through the ANOVA steps again:

1. **Calculate the Mean**:
   - Mean for Group A: (1 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 3) / 5 = 2.2
   - Mean for Group B: (2 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 4) / 5 = 3.2
   - Mean for Group C: (3 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 5) / 5 = 3.2

2. **Calculate the Overall Mean**:
   - Overall Mean: (1 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 5) / 15 = 2.73

3. **Calculate the Sum of Squares Between Groups (SSB)**:
   - SSB = (5*(2.2 - 2.73)^2) + (5*(3.2 - 2.73)^2) + (5*(3.2 - 2.73)^2) ≈ 4.73

4. **Calculate the Sum of Squares Within Groups (SSW)**:
   - SSW = (1-2.2)^2 + (2-2.2)^2 + (4-2.2)^2 + (1-2.2)^2 + (3-2.2)^2 + (2-3.2)^2 + (3-3.2)^2 + (5-3.2)^2 + (2-3.2)^2 + (4-3.2)^2 + (3-3.2)^2 + (4-3.2)^2 + (1-3.2)^2 + (3-3.2)^2 + (5-3.2)^2 ≈ 18.67

5. **Calculate the Degrees of Freedom (DF)**:
   - DF Between Groups = 3 - 1 = 2
   - DF Within Groups = 15 - 3 = 12

6. **Calculate the Mean Squares (MS)**:
   - MSB = SSB / DF Between Groups ≈ 4.73 / 2 ≈ 2.37
   - MSW = SSW / DF Within Groups ≈ 18.67 / 12 ≈ 1.56

7. **Calculate the F-value**:
   - F = MSB / MSW ≈ 2.37 / 1.56 ≈ 1.52

8. **Determine the Critical Value**:

Using a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 and degrees of freedom (2, 12), the critical value for the F-distribution is approximately 3.89.

9. **Compare F-value to Critical Value**:

Since the calculated F-value (1.52) is less than the critical value (3.89), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is no significant difference in exam scores between the study methods.

In this example, despite introducing different numbers in each group, the ANOVA analysis still indicates no significant difference between the study methods.
