p value is between 0 to 1.

p = 0.1 
10 out of 100, null hypothesis is true


p = 0.3 
30 out of 100, null hypothesis is true


T test comapres two means

p = 0.03

3 out of 100 hypothesis is true.



Level of significance can be value between 0 and 1.


The p-value tells us how likely it is to get a result like this if the null
hypothesis is true.

The level of statistical significance is often expressed as a p-value between 0 and 1. The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence that you should reject the null hypothesis. A p-value less than 0.05 (typically â‰¤ 0.05) is statistically significant.

 P-values are calculated from the deviation between the observed value and a chosen reference value, given the probability distribution of the statistic, with a greater difference between the two values corresponding to a lower p-value.
