A random variable is a variable whose value is unknown or a function that assigns values to each of an experiment's outcomes. 


A random variable is different from an algebraic variable. The variable in an algebraic equation is an unknown value that can be calculated. The equation 10 + x = 13 shows that we can calculate the specific value for x which is 3. On the other hand, a random variable has a set of values, and any of those values could be the resulting outcome as seen in the example of the dice above.



––––– Example: 
Discrete 
Random variable X : amount of snow in a year
Random variable X : Drawing a king from deck of 52 cards


Continuous
Random variable X : Kilograms of steel produced in a year.
Random variable X : Average test scores a class receives

––––––––––––– Types of Random Variables
A random variable has a probability distribution that represents the likelihood that any of the possible values would occur. Let’s say that the random variable, Z, is the number on the top face of a die when it is rolled once. The possible values for Z will thus be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The probability of each of these values is 1/6 as they are all equally likely to be the value of Z.



It allows to know the likelihood that a specific value will occur.

Mathematical function that shows all possible outcomes and their associated probabilities for an experiment.

–––––––– Distribution Types
1. Discrete 
2. Continuous
3. Cumulative 
4. Joint


Cumulative and Joint distribution are special case of discrete and Continuous distribution.
