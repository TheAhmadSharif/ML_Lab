# 📊 Contingency Table: Definition, Usage, and Example

---

## ✅ What is a Contingency Table?

A **contingency table** (also called a **cross-tabulation** or **cross-tab**) is a table used in statistics to display the **frequency distribution** of two or more **categorical variables**.

It helps in analyzing the **relationship or association** between those variables.

## 📌 When is a Contingency Table Used?

- To **examine the relationship** between two categorical variables.
- In **chi-square tests of independence**.
- For **summarizing survey data**, **experimental results**, and **classification data**.
- Commonly used in **market research**, **medicine**, **social sciences**, etc.

## 📊 Example: Gender vs Preferred Sport

Suppose we survey 100 people about their gender and preferred sport.

| Gender  | Football | Basketball | Cricket | Total |
|---------|----------|------------|---------|-------|
| Male    |   20     |     15     |   25    |  60   |
| Female  |   10     |     20     |   10    |  40   |
| Total   |   30     |     35     |   35    | 100   |

- **Variables**:
  - `Gender`: Male, Female
  - `Preferred Sport`: Football, Basketball, Cricket

- **Interpretation**:
  - 20 males prefer football.
  - 20 females prefer basketball.
  - A total of 30 people prefer football.

## 🧪 Statistical Use: Chi-Square Test of Independence

We can use this contingency table to test if there's a **statistical association between gender and sport preference** using the **Chi-square test of independence**.

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: Gender and sport preference are independent.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: Gender and sport preference are dependent.
