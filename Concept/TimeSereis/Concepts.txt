1. Autocorrelation
2. Partial Autocorrelation


Partial Autocorrelation:

Partial autocorrelation — Theory and implementation
This one is a bit tougher to understand. It does the same as regular autocorrelation — shows the correlation of a sequence with itself lagged by some number of time units. But there’s a twist. Only the direct effect is shown, and all intermediary effects are removed.

For example, you want to know the direct relationship between the number of passengers today and 12 months ago. You don’t care about anything in between.

The number of passengers 12 months affects the number of passengers 11 months ago — and the whole chain repeats until the most recent period. These indirect effects are neglected in partial autocorrelation calculations.

You should also make the time series stationary before calculations.
