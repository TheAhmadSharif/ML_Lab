Roll a fair four-sided die twice, and let X be the maximum of the two outcomes. The
outcome space for this experiment is S0 = {(d1 , d2 ) : d1 = 1, 2, 3, 4; d2 = 1, 2, 3, 4},
where we assume that each of these 16 points has probability 1/16. Then P(X =
1) = P[(1, 1)] = 1/16, P(X = 2) = P[{(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}] = 3/16, and similarly
P(X = 3) = 5/16 and P(X = 4) = 7/16. That is, the pmf of X can be written simply
as
f (x) = P(X = x) =
2x − 1

x = 1, 2, 3, 4.

We could add that f (x) = 0 elsewhere; but if we do not, the reader should take f (x)
to equal zero when x ∈
/ S = {1, 2, 3, 4}.
A better understanding of a particular probability distribution can often be
obtained with a graph that depicts the pmf of X. Note that the graph of the pmf
when f (x) > 0 would be simply the set of points {[x, f (x)] : x ∈ S}, where S is the
space of X. Two types of graphs can be used to give a better visual appreciation of
the pmf: a line graph and a probability histogram. A line graph of the pmf f (x) of
the random variable X is a graph having a vertical line segment drawn from (x, 0) to
[x, f (x)] at each x in S, the space of X. If X can assume only integer values, a proba-
bility histogram of the pmf f (x) is a graphical representation that has a rectangle of
height f (x) and a base of length 1, centered at x for each x ∈ S, the space of X. Thus,
the area of each rectangle is equal to the respective probability f (x), and the total
area of a probability histogram is 1.
Figure 2.1-1 displays a line graph and a probability histogram for the pmf f (x)
defined in Equation 2.1-1.
Our next probability model uses the material in Section 1.2 on methods of enu-
meration. Consider a collection of N = N1 +N2 similar objects, N1 of them belonging
to one of two dichotomous classes (red chips, say) and N2 of them belonging to
the second class (blue chips, say). A collection of n objects is selected from these
N objects at random and without replacement. Find the probability that exactly x
(where the nonnegative integer x satisfies x ≤ n, x ≤ N1 , and n − x ≤ N2 ) of these
n objects belong to the first class and n − x belong to the second. Of course, we can
 

select x objects from the first class in any one of
ways and n−x objects from the

A lot (collection) consisting of 100 fuses is inspected by the following procedure:
Five fuses are chosen at random and tested; if all five blow at the correct amperage,
the lot is accepted. Suppose that the lot contains 20 defective fuses. If X is a random
variable equal to the number of defective fuses in the sample of 5, the probability of
accepting the lot is
