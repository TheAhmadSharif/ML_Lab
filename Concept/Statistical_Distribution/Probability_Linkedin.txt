## Experiment And Trials
Any procedures that can be infinitely repeated

Example: Flipping a coin


Sample Space: All possible outcomes of an experiment 

Event: Subset of sample space

Example: Roll six-sided die

Event of odd rolls : A = {1, 3, 5}


## Random Variable

Random Variable X: Amount of snow in a year. 
Values: 0 to maximum amount of snow



Discrete Random Variable
Probability distribution that contains a finite or countable number of values, represented by this equation. 


## Probability Distribution

Mathematical function that shows all possible outcomes and their associated probabilities for an experiment.


Coin Toss Example 

Random variable X: outcome of one fair coin toss.
Values: Heads or Tails

Probability Function
Mathematical function that denotes the probabilities for the possible outcomes of a random variable, represented by f(x)



A PMF is a subset of Probability Functions.
Specifically, it's the Probability Function used for discrete random variables

The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) is a function that represents the probability that a random variable 
X. X will take a value less than or equal to a specific value  x. In other words, it gives the cumulative probability up to a certain point.

Mathematically, the CDF is defined as:

F(x)= P(X≤x)


Example of CDF
Let’s consider a simple example with a discrete random variable:

Suppose you roll a fair six-sided die. The possible outcomes are 
X = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }
X={1,2,3,4,5,6}, each with a probability of 

The CDF for this die roll would be:

F(x) = P(X ≤ x )
F(x) = P(X≤x)
For  x = 1

F(1) = P(X≤1)=1/6

 
For x =2:

F(2) = P(X≤2) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3

 
For x= 3 
F(3) = P(X≤3) = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2

A small bakery sells cupcakes. The number of cupcakes sold each day (X) is a random variable with the following probability distribution:

P(X = 0) = 0.1 (No cupcakes sold)
P(X = 1) = 0.2 (One cupcake sold)
P(X = 2) = 0.3 (Two cupcakes sold)
P(X = 3) = 0.25 (Three cupcakes sold)
P(X = 4) = 0.15 (Four cupcakes sold)
Verify that this is a valid PMF.
What is the probability of selling at least two cupcakes?
What is the probability of selling between 1 and 3 cupcakes, inclusive?
Solution:

Verification of a Valid PMF:

All probabilities are non-negative (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.25, 0.15).
The sum of the probabilities is: 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.25 + 0.15 = 1.0.
Therefore, this is a valid PMF.
Probability of Selling at Least Two Cupcakes:

"At least two" means 2, 3, or 4 cupcakes.
P(X ≥ 2) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)
(X ≥ 2) = 0.3 + 0.25 + 0.15 = 0.7


 The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF): Probability that random variable X is less than or equal to x.
