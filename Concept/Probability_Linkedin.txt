07 March 2025



## Experiment And Trials
Any procedures that can be infinitely repeated

Example: Flipping a coin


Sample Space: All possible outcomes of an experiment 

Event: Subset of sample space

Example: Roll six-sided die

Event of odd rolls : A = {1, 3, 5}


## Random Variable

Random Variable X: Amount of snow in a year. 
Values: 0 to maximum amount of snow



Discrete Random Variable
Probability distribution that contains a finite or countable number of values, represented by this equation. 


## Probability Distribution

Mathematical function that shows all possible outcomes and their associated probabilities for an experiment.


Coin Toss Example 

Random variable X: outcome of one fair coin toss.
Values: Heads or Tails



––––––––– Distribution Types 
Discrete
Continuous 
Cumulative
Joint

Probability Function
Mathematical function that denotes the probabilities for the possible outcomes of a random variable, represented by f(x)



A PMF is a subset of Probability Functions.
Specifically, it's the Probability Function used for discrete random variables

Probability Mass function

Distribution
————————————————————————
The possible values a variable can take and how frequently they occur.

The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) is a function that represents the probability that a random variable 
X. X will take a value less than or equal to a specific value  x. In other words, it gives the cumulative probability up to a certain point.

Mathematically, the CDF is defined as:

F(x)= P(X≤x)


Example of CDF
Let’s consider a simple example with a discrete random variable:

Suppose you roll a fair six-sided die. The possible outcomes are 
X = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }
X={1,2,3,4,5,6}, each with a probability of 

The CDF for this die roll would be:

F(x) = P(X ≤ x )
F(x) = P(X≤x)
For  x = 1

F(1) = P(X≤1)=1/6

 
For x =2:

F(2) = P(X≤2) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3

 
For x= 3 
F(3) = P(X≤3) = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2
