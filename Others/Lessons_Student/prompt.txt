y = b0 + b1x1 + e

y = CompoundedReturn 
b1 = Intercept
b1 = Coefficient estimate
e = Error term

St_Dummy = The dummy variables will test whether the average mean of the winter period is significant. If the mean of the winter period is significant then it indicates that the winter period has significantly higher return than the summer period and thus the Halloween
effect exists.


The dummy variable x1 takes the value of 1 during November to April and value 0 during
May-October.

The dummy variable x1
takes the value of 1 during November to April and value 0 during
May-October. The regression measures whether the returns during the period November to
April are different from the period May-October. Without the dummy variable the equation is
a random walk model



Due to the structure of the dummy variable the regression becomes a simple mean test, which
tests whether the mean return for November to April is higher than the mean return for the
period April to October. If the mean is higher for November to April this is indicated by the
coefficient estimate for the dummy variable being positive and significant.



The p-value for the intercept thus test whether intercept is significantly different from zero;

H0 : mu = 0
H1: mu not equal to zero

Instructions
–––––––––––––––––––
Studying the Halloween effect. If the α 1  coefficient is positive and statistically significant the effect exists. The regression's task is to compare the mean returns in the summer (May-October) and winter (November-April)

1. Share code in R




Give me few examples of logarithmic return to understand this concept

Why St_Dummy dependent variable as it has binary value. Please enlighten me



data$Log_Return <- log(data$Closing.price) - lag(log(data$Closing.price))
data$Log_Return <- diff(log(data$Closing.price))


Does both calculate same
