Could we have one more session where we go through my task, how the regressions work, how they work in R and how to analyze the results for my task specifically? 




Correlation Coefficient
R-Squared (R² or the coefficient of determination)


Multiple linear regression
Example: 

House Rent = Interest Rate + Inflation + Location + Facilities/Amenities + Space size

Yearly Rice yield = Soli + Water + Fertilizer 


Ice Cream Sales = Temperature + School Holidays + Daily Rainfalls + ? (Unexplained)


R Square = 0.61 it can explain 61 percent of the variation in size.

R-square value tells you how much variation is explained by your model.



Simple Linear Regression:
Test Score = β0 + β1 * Study Hours + ε

Multiple Linear Regression:
Test Score = β0 + β1 * Study Hours + β2 * Prep Classes + β3 * GPA + ε



Durbin-Watson:



It is believed thayt a candy machine makes chocholate bars that are on average 5g. A worker claims that the machine after maintenance no longer makes 5g bars. 


Ho: mu = 5g
H1: mu not equal to 5g.  It could be greater than 5 or less than 5.


Null hypothesis existing belief
New thigns is true.


Significant difference found = Reject the null hypothesis
No Significant difference found = Accept the null hypothesis



Null Hypothesis:  H0: There is no difference in the salary of factory workers based on gender.
Alternative Hypothesis:  Ha: Male factory workers have a higher salary than female factory workers.


Null Hypothesis:  H0: There is no relationship between height and shoe size.
Alternative Hypothesis:  Ha: There is a positive relationship between height and shoe size.


Null Hypothesis:  H0: Experience on the job has no impact on the quality of a brick mason’s work.
Alternative Hypothesis:  Ha: The quality of a brick mason’s work is influenced by on-the-job experience.'




The average height is 175 cm.


20 studenrs 174 cm

Autocorrelation, also known as serial correlation

Durbin Watson Test

What Is Heteroskedasticity?
In statistics, heteroskedasticity (or heteroscedasticity) happens when the standard deviations of a predicted variable, monitored over different values of an independent variable or as related to prior time periods, are non-constant. 



Adjusted R²


If useless predictors are added to the model. Adjusted R square will decrease.
If useful predictors are added to the model. Adjusted R square will decrease.


Should I Use Adjusted R-Squared or R-Squared?
Using adjusted R-squared over R-squared may be favored because of its ability to make a more accurate view of the correlation between one variable and another. Adjusted R-squared does this by taking into account how many independent variables are added to a particular model against which the stock index is measured.
