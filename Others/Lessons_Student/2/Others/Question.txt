I am using the same regression as Bouman & Jacobsen (2002). Studying the Halloween effect. If the Î± 1  coefficient is positive and statistically significant the effect exists. The regression's task is to compare the mean returns in the summer (May-October) and winter (November-April)


=MONTH(A2:A289)
=COUNTIF(D$3:D$289, F3)
=AVERAGEIF(F2, F289, G2, D2, D289)


Due to personal circumstances, I would like to take todays lesson at tomorrow at the same time. Apologies for any inconvenience.
