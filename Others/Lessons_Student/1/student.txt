I am using the same regression as Bouman & Jacobsen (2002). Studying the Halloween effect. If the Î± 1  coefficient is positive and statistically significant the effect exists. The regression's task is to compare the mean returns in the summer (May-October) and winter (November-April)





Hi,

According to superprof platform the first zoom session(Introductory: Free) was on 15.12 at 10:00. However, I took the session in advance on 12.12 unoffcially. So can you please add 2 hours for my effort. 

15.12  zoom session + Exercise R code : 2 Hours.




The Superprof platform scheduled the first Zoom session (Introductory: Free) for December 15th at 10:00. But I actually joined an unofficial session on December 12th beforehand. Could you please acknowledge my effort by adding 2 extra hours for that session?

So, including the Zoom session on December 15th and working on the R code exercise, it totals 2 hours.

sure, we can schedule another session either tomorrow (25.12 - Christmas holiday) or the day after (26.12) at 22:00.

Could you kindly provide me with the topics for the upcoming session?

1. Will this session focus on R code or the task you previously mentioned or Regression Analysis?


Note: I'm not interested in enrolling in a course.
