Instructions
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––


1. Use regression as Bouman & Jacobsen and test Halloween effect. If the α 1  coefficient is positive and statistically significant the effect exists. The regression's task is to compare the mean returns in the summer (May-October) and winter (November-April)

1. Use the data data.csv and Share R Code


R Code
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

library(dplyr)
library(lmtest)
library(lubridate)

setwd("/home/ahmad/Desktop/Madlen")
data <- read.csv("data.csv")
data$Date <- as.Date(data$Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
data$Month <- as.integer(format(data$Date, "%m"))
data$Season <- ifelse(data$Month %in% c(11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4), "Winter", "Summer")
data$Winter <- ifelse(data$Season == "Winter", 1, 0)
model <- lm(Compounded.return ~ Winter, data = data)
model
summary(model)


# Compounded.return = −0.001992 + 0.014374×Winter

#
Winter coefficient is positive (0.014374), it implies that, on average, the Compounded Return tends to be higher during the Winter months compared to the Summer months.
