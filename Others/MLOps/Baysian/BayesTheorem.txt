A certain disease has an incidence rate of 0.8%. If the false negative rate is 5% and the false positive rate is 3%, compute the probability that a person who tests positive actually has the disease.


			Disease   		No Disease
Test +ve    True Positive   False Positive
Test -ve    True Negative   False Negative


P(Disease/Test + ve) = P(Disease) x P(Test+ve/ Disease)/ True Positve + False Positive
