Parameter
––––––––––––––––––––––––––
A parameter is a number describing a whole population (e.g., population mean), while a statistic is a number describing a sample


Conditional Probability:

Weather Events:
Suppose the probability of rain on any given day is 
P(Rain) = 0.3
P(Cloudy) = 0.6
Assuming independence (which might not be accurate in reality as weather conditions can be correlated), the probability of a day being both rainy and cloudy would be calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities:
P(Rain and Cloudy)=P(Rain)×P(Cloudy)=0.3×0.6=0.18


Example 1: A bag contains 5 red balls and 7 blue balls. Two balls are drawn without replacement. What is the probability that the second ball drawn is red, given that the first ball drawn was red?

P(A) = 5/12 

and P(B) = 4/11

Internet speed fluctuates for last 2-3 weeks so frequently in my connection? Does anyone have the same expereince  

My Internet connection fluctuated frequently the past 2-3 weeks. Has anyone else faced a similar experience?

My Internet connection has been up and down a lot in the last few weeks. Does anyone have the same expereince?



Likelihood function : how do we form a likelihood given observed data?
- kernel and normalizing constant
- In Bayesian statistics spotting kernels of distributions can be very
useful in deriving posterior distributions.




In simpler terms, a kernel is like a lens through which you look at your data. It helps you understand relationships between points, how they influence each other, or how they might change.

What is  Function




In Bayesian inference, the beta distribution is the conjugate prior probability distribution for the Bernoulli, binomial, negative binomial and geometric distributions.

I'll try for a session on Friday at 10:00, but I'll confirm tomorrow night.

You mentioned a couple of topics - Regression Analysis and OLS. Can you share any others if I've missed any? It'll help me prepare for the lecture.
