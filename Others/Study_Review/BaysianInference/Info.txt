Hi,

How can I help you? Can you share your specifics?


What is kernal
What is conjugate prior

What is kernels of distributions 

In some contexts, the term "kernel" refers to the shape or mathematical expression that defines a probability distribution. 


How to find a kernal of a distributin


What is the kernal of Binomial distributions
What is the kernal of Poisson distributions in Baysian statistics

Does Kernal and probobility mass function are same



Gamma Distribution
Inverse Gamma Distribution
Binomial Beta Distribution


What is normalizing constant in Baysian Inference

1. Data from a 1991 Gallup opinion poll about the morality of President Bush’s not helping
Iraqi rebel groups after the formal end of the Gulf War.
Of the 751 adults responding, 150 thought the President’s actions were not moral. Suppose
we assume a noninformative Beta(0.01, 0.01) prior on the probability π that a randomly
sampled adults would respond ’immoral’.

a) Run the samples more than 5000 iterations. Obtain the posterior mean and 95%
posterior credible interval on π. Examine the posterior density estimate for π. Repeat
with the uniform (0,1) prior. Set the initial values: π = 0.5.



b) Suppose now our sample size was only 8 with 0 adults considering the Presidential
action immoral. Using 3 different priors on π: Beta (0.01,0.01), uniform(0,1)=Beta(1,1),
and Beta (0.5,0.5), compare posterior means and 95% posterior credible intervals on π.
What do you find when the sample size is small?


c) Use the model to predict the number of replying immoral in new survey. Then, compute
the new probability for group responding ’immoral’.
