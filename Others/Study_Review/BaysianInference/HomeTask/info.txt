In Olympic games there may be potential benefits that a host country may experience
in terms of performance and support. We want to explore such an advantage by examining
the rate of medals per participant in the host year compared to their previous Olympics.

Let Xi1 be the number of medals won by the host country during the Olympics i and Xi0
be the number of medals won by the county in the previous Olympics. Similarly, let Ni0
and Ni1 be the number of participants from the country in the corresponding Olympics.
For example, Finland hosted the Olympics in 1952. They had N11 = 258 participants in
1952 and N10 = 129 participants in the 1948; they won X11 = 22 medals in 1952 and
X10 = 24 medals in the 1948.

a) To assess broadly for a host country advantage, first combine data across all years for
P
P18
the host county in the host year, X1 = 18
i=1 Xi1 and N1 =
i=1 Ni1 .
Conduct a Bayesian analysis of λ1 , the expected number of medals per participant in their
home country, assuming a Poisson sampling model, Poisson(N1 λ1 ) and the prior distribu-
tion Gamma(0.1, rate=0.1). (Note : Gamma(0.1, rate=0.1) = Gamma(0.1, scale=10) :
parametrization used in our course.)

b) Conduct a Bayesian test of the hypothesis that there is a home-county advantage, λ1 >
λ0 , i.e. compute the the posterior probability that λ1 > λ0 . (Direct sampling through
Monte Carlo simulation with e.g. 100,000 sampling offers one easy method to approximate
such a probability.)
Are your results sensitive to the prior? Compute the posterior probability over (3-4) different
sets of hyper-prior parameters.

c) Choose 5 different countries and conduct an analysis separately by country by comparing
the posterior distribution of the ratio r = λ1 /λ0 for each county. Is there evidence that the
home-country advantage differs by country?
(Combine the data across the two Olympics for Australia, Japan and USA. Then there are
a total of 15 counties.)
