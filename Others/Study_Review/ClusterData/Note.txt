Learning Outcomes

After the course, the student can apply modern statistical modeling tools especially for longitudinal data analysis and clustered data problems. The student understands the theory of linear and generalized linear mixed models and can form nonlinear mixed models under normal distribution.

Quasi-Likelihood Methods


1. Can you share any project idea with Longitudinal research study ?
2. How kinds of data do I need for R in that case?
3. What kinds of methods are available in that case ?
