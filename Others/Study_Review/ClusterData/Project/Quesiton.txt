\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Gold Medals:} The estimate for gold medals is 0.0605 (p = 0.00726). This suggests that for each additional gold medal won by a country, the expected total medal count increases by approximately 6.05\%. This effect is statistically significant.
    \item \textbf{Silver Medals:} The estimate for silver medals is -0.0106 (p = 0.73796), suggesting that silver medals do not significantly affect the total medal count.
    \item \textbf{Bronze Medals:} The estimate for bronze medals is 0.0776 (p = 0.00698), indicating that each additional bronze medal increases the total medal count by 7.76\%. This effect is statistically significant.
    \item \textbf{GDP Per Capita:} The estimate for GDP Per Capita is 0.000003158 (p = 0.30758), which is not statistically significant. This suggests that GDP Per Capita is not a strong predictor of total medals.
    \item \textbf{Population:} The estimate for population is -0.0003756 (p = 0.31368), indicating that population size is not significantly associated with total medals.
    \item \textbf{Random Intercept (Country):} The random effect variance is 0.2384 with a standard deviation of 0.4883. This indicates some variability in total medal counts across countries that is not explained by the fixed effects.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Model Diagnostics}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AIC/BIC:} The AIC of the model is 507.8, and the BIC is 525.3. These values can be used to compare the fit of this model to alternative models.
    \item \textbf{Residuals:} The scaled residuals are fairly well-distributed, with no extreme outliers.
    \item \textbf{Convergence Warning:} The model did not fully converge, showing a degenerate Hessian with one negative eigenvalue. This suggests potential instability in the estimates, and rescaling some predictor variables or modifying the model might be necessary.
\end{itemize}


\section{Conclusion}

The analysis indicates that GDP Per Capita and population size do not have a significant impact on a country's total medal count in the 2024 Olympic Games. While GDP Per Capita shows a positive but weak relationship, and population has a slight negative effect, neither is statistically significant.
\newline
Gold and bronze medals are strong predictors of total medal count, with positive and significant effects. In contrast, silver medals show a weak and uncertain negative trend.
\newline
Additionally, regional differences suggest that cultural, historical, or infrastructural factors might influence Olympic performance beyond economic indicators.
\newline
Overall, predicting Olympic success is complex, with gold and bronze medals playing a key role, while GDP Per Capita and population have weaker and less certain effects.
