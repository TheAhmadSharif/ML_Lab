3: a) 1.5: Try to chararacterize the trends of different brands in relation to the overall trend shown in the first figure. b) 1: Try to be more specific. For example, how does the expected number of live animals change (percentage change) for different broods when the concentration of the pesticide increases by one unit.  c) 1: You could also compare the estimates and their standard errors.
