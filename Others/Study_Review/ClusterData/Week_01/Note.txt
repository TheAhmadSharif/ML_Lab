The exam will be an electronic exam (for instructions, see https://sites.tuni.fi/exam-en/), which will open in the exam week. 

There will be 4 questions which are similar to the weekly exercises, containing both theoretical problems and empirical data analysis. In addition, there may be essay questions and definitions of statistical concepts. You can use Wacom drawing screens to write solutions that contain mathematical formulas.

What is homicide?
Homicide is the act of one person killing another person.

What is quasi-score?
Quasi-likelihood methods


Quasi-Likelihood Models:

Quasi-likelihood models are used when we know the mean and variance of the data but not the full distribution (e.g., overdispersed Poisson data).


What is robust in statistics ? 
Share with example

A method is robust if it performs well even when assumptions are violated or when the data contains outliers. Robust techniques ensure stable and reliable results in real-world data, which often deviates from ideal assumptions.

The null hypothesis would state that both models are equally good at explaining the data — that is, there is no significant difference between the models.


The p-value from the test is 0.8256, which is much greater than 0.05.
This means that we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no significant difference between model_1 (with factor(color)) and model_2 (with continuous color). Both models are essentially equally good at explaining the data.


And what is alternative hypothesis in my case of example?


There is a significant difference between the two models, meaning that one model provides a significantly better fit to the data than the other.




The p-value from the test is 0.8256, which is much greater than 0.05.
This means that we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no significant difference between model_1 (with factor(color)) and model_2 (with continuous color). Both models are essentially equally good at explaining the data.



In a case, If model_1 and model_2 both cases, coefficients p-vlaue is less than 0.05. In that what does that refer ? 





What does Null deviance and Residual deviance refers ?


The reduction in deviance (199.23 - 194.00 = 5.23) indicates that the model with predictors explains 5.23 units more of the variation in the outcome variable compared to the null model.

The ZINB model suggests that color is significantly associated with the probability of zero inflation (excess zeros), and the Negative Binomial part suggests overdispersion.
Likelihood Ratio Test cannot be performed between the ZINB and NB2 models because they are non-nested.
You can compare the models using AIC/BIC to determine which provides a better fit to the data.

What is zero-inflated negtive binomial


color: -0.2689 (NB2)
This negative coefficient for color indicates that higher color scores are associated with lower counts of crabs. This is opposite to the result in the ZINB model, where a higher color score increases the probability of observing a zero count


The AIC for the NB2 model is 768.68.
The AIC for the zero-inflated model is calculated as:
AIC = − 2 ×(−363) + 2 × 4 = 734
AIC=−2×(−363)+2×4=734
Here, the zero-inflated model has a lower AIC of 734, which indicates that the zero-inflated model provides a better fit to the data.

The color is a significant predictor when it is considered quantitative. Interpretation: the odds ratio for
a female crab for her having at least one male satellite is exp(1.6531) = 5.2231 when the comparison is
made with a crab that weighs 1 kg less. Further, the odds ratio is exp(−0.5142) = 0.5980 when the crab is
compared with a crab belonging to the closest lower darkness category.
The interaction effect is not significant, irrespective of whether the color is modeled as categorical or
quantitative.
