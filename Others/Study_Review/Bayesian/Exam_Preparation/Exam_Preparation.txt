Brief the following concept with simple analogy



Predictive Distribution
Want to predict a future observation y given that we have observed
X = (X1 , ..., Xn ). Assume that X1 , ..., Xn are independent given θ.
Bayesian inference about y is based on its posterior predictive distribution:

Brief the following concept with simple analogy : Hierarchical Models

Hierarchical Models
Hierarchical modeling is used when information is available on several
different levels of observational units.
