Prune the vocabulary to remove stopwords,

what is pruning in nlp


Pruning is also used when we are building our word pairs for training purposes using context builder. When you have a large amount of vocabulary to deal with, if you have included less frequent words, then you need to remove them. You can also restrict the size of the total vocabulary by using the max_vocab_size parameter given in the Python gensim library.


Pruning is a useful technique in machine learning for decreasing the size and complexity of prepared models. 


Practical Understanding of Corpus and Dataset


prunned_word_list = []
    
for word in unified_vocabulary:
    if(word not in stop_words):
        prunned_word_list.append(word)
        
    if (word in highest_totaloccurrences_indices[\
        0:int(numpy.floor(len(unified_vocabulary)*0.01))]):
        print(word)

print(prunned_word_list[300:330])  

highest_totaloccurrences_indices = numpy.argsort(\
    -1*unifiedvocabulary_totaloccurrencecounts, axis=0)


print(highest_totaloccurrences_indices, "highest_totaloccurrences_indices")



print(unified_vocabulary[130:140])

## prunned_word_list
stop_words = nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english')

start_with = ""
new_stopwords = ["!", "#", "%", "'", "(", ")", "$", "*", "-", "--", ".", "''", "_*"]
stop_words.extend(new_stopwords)


pruned_word_list =[] 

for word in unified_vocabulary:
    # Rule 1: check the nltk stop word list
     if(word not in stop_words):
        pruned_word_list.append(word)

for years

x = re.search("*for*years", book_content)
print(x)


I do not know the road condition. I have to make a test drive as today the first snow in the winter.

regex = '*for *years'
x = re.search(regex, text)
print(x)
