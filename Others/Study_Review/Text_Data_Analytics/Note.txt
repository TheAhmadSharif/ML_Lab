https://deepai.org/chat . Some chatbots

It is also possible to install an offline chatbot on your own computer (for example KoboldCPP,
https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp or LM studio, https://lmstudio.ai ).
Alternatively, if you are unable to (or do not wish to) use a chatbot at all, you can also write the
answer completely by yourself without starting from a chatbot answer.

Heuristics Definition
A heuristic is a mental shortcut commonly used to simplify problems and avoid cognitive overload. H

Applications of NLP
————————————————————————
The applications of Natural Language Processing are as follows:

Text and speech processing like-Voice assistants – Alexa, Siri, etc.
Text classification like Grammarly, Microsoft Word, and Google Docs
Information extraction like-Search engines like DuckDuckGo, Google
Chatbot and Question Answering like:- website bots
Language Translation like:- Google Translate
Text summarization


Tokenization
————————————————————————
Tokenization refers to break down the text into smaller units. It entails splitting paragraphs into sentences and sentences into words. It is one of the initial steps of any NLP pipeline. Let us have a look at the two major kinds of tokenization that NLTK provides:
''



Markov Assumption

Corpus
————————————————————————
A corpus is a collection of authentic text or audio organized into datasets. ‘Authentic’ in this case means text written or audio spoken by a native of the language or dialect. A corpus can be made up of everything from newspapers, novels, recipes and radio broadcasts to television shows, movies and tweets.

A corpus can be defined as a collection of text documents. It can be thought as just a bunch of text files in a directory, often alongside many other directories of text files.
