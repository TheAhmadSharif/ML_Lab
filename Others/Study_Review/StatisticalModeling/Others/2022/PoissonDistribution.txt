Poisson Distribution
————————————————————————
The Poisson distribution deals with frequency with which an event occurs in a specific interval.

Only one parameter
No of kids you have
Mean is equal to the variance
Poisson -> Low success with specific time
Events are occuring independently.


Image result for Poisson Distribution
The Poisson distribution is a discrete distribution that measures the probability of a given number of events happening in a specified time period.

Data are counts of events.
All events are independent.
The average rate of occurrence does not change during the period of interest.

f(x) = P(X=x) = (e-λ λx )/x!

mean = variance = λ

Y ~ Poisson(λ)
Properties
To count the number of defects of a finished product
To count the number of deaths in a country by any disease or natural calamity
To count the number of infected plants in the field
To count the number of bacteria in the organisms or the radioactive decay in atoms
To calculate the waiting time between the events.

Example 1: In a cafe, the customer arrives at a mean rate of 2 per min. Find the probability of arrival of 5 customers in 1 minute using the Poisson distribution formula.

Solution:

Given: λ = 2, and x = 5.

Using the Poisson distribution formula:

P(X = x) = (e-λ λx )/x!

P(X = 5) = (e-2 25 )/5!

P(X = 6) = 0.036

Answer: The probability of arrival of 5 customers per minute is 3.6%.

The average number of homes sold by the Acme Realty company is 2 homes per day. What is the probability that exactly 3 homes will be sold tomorrow?



Example 1: A small business receives on average 12 customers a day

a) What is the probabiltiy that the business will receive exactly 8 customers in one fay?


Example 2: A student receives, 7 text messages in 2 hours perid.

a) What is the probability that the student will recive exactly 9 messges in a 2 hours period?

b) What is the probability that the student will recive exactly 24 messges in a 2 hours period?



Somebody tried to commit suicide. MOst people do not try to commit suicide these are not normally distributed.



Three component in GLM.
1. Systemic Component  y = ax + b + e;
2. Link function

Link function is nothring but mathematical function
y = x^2
y = 1/(x+10)
y = log(x)

Cumulative Poisson Probability
———————————————————————————————
A cumulative Poisson probability refers to the probability that the Poisson random variable is greater than some specified lower limit and less than some specified upper limit.

Cumulative Poisson Example

Suppose the average number of lions seen on a 1-day safari is 5. What is the probability that tourists will see fewer than four lions on the next 1-day safari?
