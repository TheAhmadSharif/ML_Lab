Maximum Likelihood Estimation
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Maximum Likelihood Estimation, or MLE for short, is a probabilistic framework for estimating the parameters of a model.

Residual
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
In statistical models, a residual is the difference between the observed value and the mean value that the model predicts for that observation.

Interaction Model
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
µjh = β0 + βj + αh + γjh


Mean square error
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
It provides a summary of the difference between values predicted by a model and the values actually observed from the environment that is being modeled.


      ActualValue       Predicted Value(y)
1         3               2.5
2         6               5.5



e1 = y−y^ = 3 − 2.5 = 0.5
e1 = y−y^ = 6 − 5.5 = 0.5

e1² = (0.5)² = 0.25
e2² = (0.5)² = 0.25

MSE = 0.25 + 0.25 / 2 = 0.25


# Define the actual and predicted values
actual <- c(3, 6)
predicted <- c(2.5, 5.5)

# Calculate MSE
mse <- mean((predicted - actual)^2)

# Print the result
print(mse)

count data models


Counts are non-negative integers. They represent the number of
occurrences of an event within a fixed period.

Note: We have rare events, in general, far from normal distributed data.


Dichotomous variables
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Dichotomous (outcome or variable) means "having only two possible values", e.g. "yes/no", "male/female", "head/tail", "age > 35 / age <= 35" etc.


A variable that can have only one of two values (typically, 0 or 1) to designate membership in one of two possible categories, such as female versus male or Republican versus Democrat. Also called binary variable.



Example:

The number of products that a consumer buys on Amazon.
The number of kids a couple has

The poisson model predicts the no of occurences of an event.


Zero-Inflated Models
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
– In count data models, there may be situations where the number of zero occurs sig-
nificantly more frequently than it should occur under Poisson or negative binomial
distribution.


Models for Binary Variable
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Logit Models for Binary Variable
– Consider the situation where the realization of the random variable Yi can have only
two different outcomes. Every binary outcome situations outcomes can be coded as
values 0 and 1.

Survival Time Analysis
————————————————————————

A group of statistical methods n which the variable studied is the time until an an event occurs.

Time until death after an illness.
Time to recover after burn out


p value is greater than 0.05. Null hypothesis is accepted. (retain)


Hazards Function
The most common use of the function is to model a participant’s chance of death as a function of their age.

Hazards and Survival Functions

The hazard function is λ(t) = f(t)/S(t). It is the probability that the person or machine or business dies in the next instant, given that it survived to time t.

Cox Regression Model
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
In survival analysis, the relationship of the hazard function to the explanatory vari-
ables is typically examined.



Cox regression (or proportional hazards regression) is method for investigating the effect of several variables upon the time a specified event takes to happen. In the context of an outcome such as death this is known as Cox regression for survival analysis
