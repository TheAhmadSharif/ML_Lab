Denote explanatory variables as X1=WoodType and X2=BoardType. Consider
modeling the response variable Y =Deection by following two different models:

Yi ∼ N(µjh, σ2),
µjh = β0 + βj + αh,

M12 : Yi ∼ N(µjh, σ2)
µjh = β0 + βj + αh + γjh,


where index j is related to the categories of the variable X1=WoodType and index h is related to the categories of the variable X2=BoardType.



a) Under the model M1|2, calculate the maximum likelihood estimate for the expected value µjh, when the explanatory variables X1, X2 are set  on values.


X1 = Oak = 4
X2 = Tappered = 42

That is, find the maximum likelihood estimate for the expected value µ42.


b) Let us assume that the modelM1|2 fits sufficiently enough to the given data set. In which tree species the estimate of expected value µjh is in highest level?

c) Under the model M12, calculate the maximum likelihood estimate for the parameter γ32

d)  Under the model M12, calculate the residual ei for the last observation i = 336 in the dataset

3. (a) Consider the following small data, where X1 is a numerical explanatory
variable and X2 is categorical explanatory variable having class values {a, b, c}.


Consider modeling the response variable Y by the following linear model:

M12 : Yi = β0 + β1xi1 + αj + γjxi1 + εi

where index j is related to the categories of X2. The model M1|2 can be
written in matrix form as

M1|2 : y = Xβ + ε, Cov(y) = σI


Write in details what kind forms the model matrix X and parameter vector
β have in case of given data is modeled by the model M12.
