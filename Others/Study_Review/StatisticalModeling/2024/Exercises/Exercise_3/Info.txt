	Dose 		Herbicide 		DryMatter
1	1 			Glyphosate		4.7
2	1 			Glyphosate		4.6
3	1 			Glyphosate		4.1
4	1 			Glyphosate		4.4


Data are from an experiment, comparing the potency of the two herbicides
glyphosate and bentazone in white mustard Sinapis alba.
Dose - a numeric vector containing the dose in g/ha.
Herbicide - a factor with levels Bentazone Glyphosate (the two herbicides applied).
DryMatter - a numeric vector containing the response (dry matter in g/pot).

Denote the variables as Y = DryMatter, X1 = Dose, and X2 = Herbicide.

(a) Let us assume Yi ∼ N (µi , σ 2 ). Consider the models
Midentity : µi = β0 + β1 xi1 + αj + γj xi1 ,
Mlog : log(µi ) = β0 + β1 xi1 + αj + γj xi1 ,
Minverse :	1/µi	= β0 + β1 xi1 + αj + γj xi1 ,

M 1/µi² : 1/µi²  = β0 + β1 xi1 + αj + γj xi1 ,

where index j is related to the categories of X2 . Which model fits
the best to the data? to the data? You may use the mean square error value MSE = (y −µ̂ )²/n
as one method of choosing the model. Return the maximum likelihood
estimate β̂1 of your chosen model as your solution for this question.


b) Let us assume Yi ∼ N (µi , σ 2 ). Consider the model
M:g(µi ) = β0 + β1 xi1 + αj + γj xi1 .
Choose the link function g based on your solution to (a). Calculate the
maximum likelihood estimate for the expected value µi∗ when X1 = 50
and X2 = Glyphosate.


c) 
Let us assume Yi ∼ N (µi , σ 2 ). Consider the model
M: g(µi ) = β0 + β1 xi1 + αj + γj xi1 .
Choose the link function g based on your solution to (a). Calculate the 95%
confidence interval estimate for the expected value µi∗ when X1 = 50 and
X2 = Glyphosate. Particularly, what is your obtained lower bound of the
confidence interval?


d) Let us assume Yi ∼ N (µi , σ 2 ). Consider the model
M: g(µi ) = β0 + β1 xi1 + αj + γj xi1 .
Choose the link function g based on your solution to (a). Create 80 % pre-
diction interval for new observation Yf , when X1 = 50 and X2 = Glyphosate.
Particularly, what is your obtained lower bound of the prediction interval?
