Denote the variables as following
Y = ozone, X1 = rad, X2 = temp, X3 = wind.
Note that the response variable Y = ozone is continuous random variable where
measurement accuracy happens to be in integer level.

(b) Choose the model based on your solution to (a). Study under different
distributional assumptions how Pearson’s residuals are behaving. That is,
consider the following linear models for Pearson residuals oi

oi² = α0 + α1µˆi + εi

suitable one?

3) a) 
Let us assume Yi ∼ IG(µi, ϕ). Consider the model
log(µi) = β0 + β1 log(xi).

Let the estimates of the parameters β0, β1, ϕ be as βˆ0 = 1, βˆ1 = 0.5, ϕ˜ = 0.05,
when


(1 log(3)
1 log(3)
1 log(3)
1 log(6)
1 log(6)
1 log(6)
1 log(9)
1 log(9)
1 log(9)
)

Calculate the estimated covariance matrix Cov( d βˆ) = (X′WX c )



b) Let Yi ∼ P oi(µi). Then the probability density function of the random
variable Yi is f(yi|µi) = e^−µi µi^yi/yi!

Show first that Yi belongs to the exponential family of distributions, and
then show that
E(Yi) = µi,
Var(Yi) = µi
Hint! There is no dispersion parameter ϕ in Poisson distribution and hence
you may consider it as ϕ = 1.

________________________________________________________________

Given that Yi ~ Poisson(µi), the probability density function of the random variable Yi is:

f(yi|µi) = e^−µi * (µi)^yi / yi!



f(yi|µi) = exp{yi * log(µi) - log(yi!) - µi} = exp{ T(yi) ∙ α - β(µi) + γ(yi) }

where:
T(yi) = yi
α = log(µi)
β(µi) = µi
γ(yi) = -log(yi!)

Therefore, Yi indeed belongs to the exponential family of distributions.

To show that E(Yi) = µi and Var(Yi) = µi, we need to use the properties of the Poisson distribution. The mean and variance of a Poisson random variable are both equal to the parameter λ of the Poisson distribution:

E(Yi) = λ = µi
Var(Yi) = λ = µi


Thus, E(Yi) = µi and Var(Yi) = µi for the Poisson distribution with parameter µi.

(c) Consider the simple Gamma model with
Yi ∼ Gamma(µi, ϕ),
µi = ηi = β0. Construct the 100(1 − α)% prediction interval for the new observation Yf .


Following steps can be followed to construct a prediction interval for a new observation:

1. Fit the Gamma Model β0 and ϕ
2. Calculate the point estimate of the response variable Yf using the estimated parameters.
3. Compute the standard error of prediction (σ_pred) for Yf.
4. Determine the quantiles of the Gamma distribution to construct the prediction interval.
